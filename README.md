# AutoEmailScriptVBA

Thank you for taking the time to view my files.

This script, written in VBA is set up to interact with a specific schedule / deliverables worksheet I use in my day to day project management. 

This is used in conjunction with the format schedule script to generate a working schedule, and from that working schedule this script generates an email that lists out past-due items.

Please feel free to contact me with questions.
